## Task 1 Data Cleaning and Data Visualization

Research Question: Which maps are the most likely to win the map vote?

How I Plan to Answer this Question:

I will first make sure I join the CODGames_p1_380 and CODGames_p2_380 datasets, making sure to keep all of the observations, to make a complete dataset of the votes and maps selected. Then I will identify which votes ended in a tie. I will store this data separaetly from the data where a normal vote took place since Map1 is always chosen when there is a tie. To do this I plan to make another dataset that is made from the filtered out the rows that have no values in the MapVote column. Next I will identify how many times each map was chosen in a tie by summarizing the data and grouping by Choice making sure to add a N() value so that the number of times each Map was chosen is in the summary. I will repeat the summary and group_by steps for the dataset containing of regular votes. From there I will take the information from the two summaries, combine them, and make a visualization that shwos the results. To represent the results from ties, and from regular votes, I want to make sure that it is shown which maps were chosen from ties. To do this, I would like to make a barchart that is made of two colors and a key, one color will represnt regular votes and the other will represent results from tied votes.

```{r}
#join datasets
JoinedCODGames <- full_join()
#filter out ties
ties <- dataset(filter())
```
